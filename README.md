# Spotify-data-analysis

Data which I chose to analyse contains informations about most streamed songs on Spotify in 2019 global. 

Data which I attached can be found and download from Kaggle. There is a ranking based on number of streams in 2019. 
In data we can find most important information like duration of the song, artist name nad streams
